        We are happy to announce our new customer loyalty program, the Sassy Selfie Program! All you have to do is snap a selfie while wearing a Sassy and Sweet item and post it in the group! For each item you post a Sassy Selfie in, you will earn a Selfie Point to apply toward your next purchase! 1 point = 1 dollar off <br>
        <br>
        Here are the details:<br>
        - It doesn't have to be a selfie, the photo can be taken by someone else. As long as it is a picture of you showing off your Sassy and Sweet Clothing Boutique item, you will receive a point.<br>
        - The next time you comment on an item to make a purchase, add a note that you would like to use your point(s), and we will apply it to your invoice.<br>
        - between now and April 15, 2019, you can post Sassy Selfies of any previous purchase to earn selfie points. A limit of 5 Selfie Points can be earned during this time. <br>
        - After April 15, 2019, the item pictured must have been purchased within the last 30 days to be eligible for earning a Selfie Point. <br>
        - Selfie Points can only be used toward purchases made through the group (Sorry, points will not be able to be redeemed through our upcoming website) <br>
        - Sassy Selfie photos are subject to being used on our website. If you do not want them to be used for our website, please notify us in writing at sassysweetclothing@yahoo.com, and we will honor your wishes :) <br>
        - Sassy Selfie Points are only valid toward future purchases and are not redeemable for cash <br>
        - The item pictured has to have been purchased from Sassy and Sweet Clothing Boutique <br>
        - Only one Selfie Point will be issued per item <br>
        <br>
        Let us know if you have any questions! ðŸ’‹<br>
